# HypixelLobbySpammer

**NOTE:** This project was made in a couple of hours for fun and was tested in a private server (although it'll work the same). I do not really encourage this and to be honest lobby spamming never works anyway from what I've seen. I was just having a bit of fun. Saying that, this script works.

The script works by partying everyone in the lobby in a queue. Once someone joins, it'll print in party chat the messages you've configured in .minecraft/config/lobbySpammer.cfg and then kick them. After this (or after a party request expires), it will send a party invite to the next person. Rinse and repeat until it's reached everyone in that lobby.
